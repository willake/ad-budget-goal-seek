## Version Control

This project follows [GitFlow](http://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html) version control rules, but not that strict.

Hereby a brief guide:

- For the `main` branch, you cannot push commits into it directly. It can only be merged from any `release` branch with a pull request. We need to make sure that every version of the `main` branch is the latest production-ready game.
- For the `develop` branch, you cannot push commits into it directly. It can only be merged from any `feature/xxx_xxx` branch with a pull request. We need to make sure that every version of the `develop` branch is a runnable game.
- If you want to add a new feature or maybe refactor any code structure, **you should create a branch named `feature/the_name_of_feature` from the develop branch.** When the branch is finished, you can create a pull request for updating the `develop` branch.
- When a `develop` branch is ready to be published, you can create a pull request to create a `release/vx.x.x` branch. The name of a branch could be `release/v0.0.1` or `release/alpha1`.
